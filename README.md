Template for project 1 proposals, work, code, etc.

First, consider that projects are 40%, so 20% each.  Each homework is 5%.  So, the effort should be on part with 4 homeworks.  Some of the project focus should be on "polish," which is a different sort of task from basic exercises.

Options:

  1. Work alone or in pairs to propose and solve a complex engineering problem.  That's generic, for sure.  My suggestion is to dig through your 500-level course textbooks and pick out some sort of "computational" or "challenge" or three-start problem.
  
  2. Work alone or in pairs to investigate, define, and solve a problem related to DMX-512, which is the class "theme."  Depending on how many want this approach, I'll set up special Zoom or in-person meetings to discuss the big picture so it's not so open ended.
  
  3. Work on your own to solve 12+ new Code Wars problems such that you get to my current rating (5 kyu, 249 honor) for 100% on the project with a sliding scale between (i.e., you do no problems, you get no % or your honor/249 x 100 is your %).  I have no idea if this is an "easy" or "hard" project alternative, but it helps those who just want to work on coding.
  
  4. Other ideas?
  
 
Proposal due...?

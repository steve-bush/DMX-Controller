My project 2 will be a continuation of the work completed in project 1. Where project 1's work was creating the base for a DMX 512 controller, project 2's goal is to fully implement it. I will be keeping the serial communication, GUI, and Arduino programs from last project. My main focus will be programming the Arduino to output a DMX packet to a light. My second goal will be expanding project 1's work to take in other the group's binary file and also allow input of different packets to be sent at varying times. If I implement the second part, I will either have to program the Arduino to use only 3 frames per DMX packet or switch to using the Raspberry Pi since the RAM in the Arduino will not be enough for multiple 512 frame packets. The Raspberry Pi solution would be the coolest, so I will try my hardest to go that direction.

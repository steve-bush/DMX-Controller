For the project 1 I will be doing the DMX-512 project with Nick Clapp. I am still not fully certain what all this will require, but I will meet with the other students working on this project to get a better idea. I will be working on the back end programming for the most part, but will work on other tasks as required. The plan for the moment seems to be that we will create a device that controls lights using a Rasperry Pi. The scope of this project will likely change as we learn more about DMX-512 and a goal for the project is not defined at the moment. For now, a plan of a software GUI for a control console and a Rasberry Pi that will act as a controller that will send the signal to multiple lights.

UPDATE
This is more complicated than we thought it would be, so the new goal is to setup our Raspberry Pi to read an input file and send it to an Arduino. We may find a way to do this without an Arduino later down the line. This will depend on the amount of free time Nick and I end up having over the next couple weeks. Will we take a deep dive into the architecture of a Raspberry Pi? Idk stay tuned
